<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Curtain Unit Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Re-circulating Air Curtains"</li><li>"Non-re-circulating Air Curtains"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Air Curtain Unit Systems market is divided into two main types: re-circulating air curtains and non-re-circulating air curtains. Re-circulating air curtains continuously draw air from the room, creating a barrier that maintains temperature and reduces energy consumption, making them ideal for climate-controlled environments. In contrast, non-re-circulating air curtains use external air, often pulling it from outside, to create a barrier, which is suitable for applications requiring fresh air and enhanced ventilation, such as retail stores and warehouses.</p></p>
